# taevas.xyz

[taevas.xyz](taevas.xyz) is a simple website meant to succeed to the [open-source](https://github.com/TTTaevas/TTTaevas.github.io) static website [TTTaevas.github.io](https://tttaevas.github.io)

As of right now, the purpose is still the same: keeping track of my osu! tournament history as both a player and a referee

## DIFFERENCES WITH TTTaevas.github.io

* The website is not hosted by GitHub
* I (Taevas) actually own the domain the website is hosted at
* There is a login system
* Depending of who you login as, you have access to more features
* These features include changing the tournaments featured on the website in various ways
* Consequently, making commits to the repository to update the tournaments is no longer needed

## LICENSE
