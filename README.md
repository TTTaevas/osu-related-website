# taevas.xyz

[taevas.xyz](https://taevas.xyz) is my personal website meant for multiple osu!-related stuff, such as my own tournament history (succeeding to my static website [TTTaevas.github.io](https://tttaevas.github.io)) or my tournaments, such as LAYER01

## TOURNAMENT HISTORY: DIFFERENCES WITH TTTaevas.github.io

* The website is not hosted by GitHub
* I (Taevas) actually own the domain the website is hosted at
* There is a login system (currently through LAYER01)
* Depending of who you login as, you have access to more features
* These features include changing the tournaments featured on the website in various ways
* Consequently, making commits to the repository to update the tournaments is no longer needed
